- text: 'This wouldn''t work: this code tries to implement multiple interfaces with
    same erasure'
- text: This wouldn't work because there is no natural order for integers of different
    types
- text: 'The idea is great: we often do not care of exact type during comparison'
- text: This wouldn't work since erasure for Byte, Integer and Long is Number
- text: This wouldn't work since class can't have multiple methods with same signatures
